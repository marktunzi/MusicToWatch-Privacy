## Summary

**Music To Watch** is designed to work locally on your devices.  
The app does not require an account and, in its current version, does not collect personal data for analytics, advertising, or tracking.

## 1. Who we are

Music To Watch is an iPhone and Apple Watch app that lets you import your own audio files, sync them to Apple Watch, and listen offline.

## 2. Data we collect

**We do not collect personal data through our own servers in the current version of the app.**

This means Music To Watch does not require account registration and does not upload your audio files to our servers.

## 3. How the app works with your data

The app may access the following on your device only to provide core functionality:

- **Files you choose to import** (for example audio files selected from the Files app)
- **Local app storage** to save imported audio and app data (such as track and playlist information)
- **Apple Watch connectivity** to transfer selected audio from your iPhone to your Apple Watch

Your imported audio is processed locally on your devices for import, storage, sync, and playback.

## 4. Analytics, advertising, and tracking

Music To Watch does not use third-party advertising SDKs and does not track you across apps or websites.

In the current version, Music To Watch does not use third-party analytics services to collect usage data.

## 5. Data sharing

We do not sell your personal data.

We do not share your imported audio files with third parties through our own servers.

Audio files and related app data are stored locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch (when synced).

You can remove audio files from the app by deleting them in the app interface (where available) or by removing the app from your device.

## 7. Children’s privacy

Music To Watch is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children through our own servers.
